# Maid Empire – Patched

Simple patched version that corrects a few syntax errors and updates ptliem007's [<img src="https://i.imgur.com/qdtKSSq.png">](https://github.com/ptliem007) [Maid Empire](https://github.com/ptliem007/Maid-Empire) to conform to Unciv's current standards.  
I also implemented Unciv's mod autoupdate to make it easier to keep the patch up-to-date.
